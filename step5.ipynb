It took me a while to find hwo to use the items method with the sorted function and the dict function to create a sorted dictionary.\n",

    "If I had more time on the project, I would look for pathways that contains the highest numbers of genes, which are likely to be an overview of multiple pathways, such as biosynthesis of amino acids (hsa01230). These can help with visualizing the metabolic difference when there are different groups or time points in a study."
