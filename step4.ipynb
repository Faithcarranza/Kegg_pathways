    "#### What was your biggest challenge in this project? (regarding writing code and not only)\n",
    "My biggest challenge in this project was to find out how to make the dataframe of links between gene and pathway into a dictionary. When I was computing the pathway count of each gene, instead of just directly getting the counts, I chose to make a dictionary with genes as keys and pathways as values to retain the information of pathway IDs. Since one gene can have multiple pathways, I supposed a dictionary is an appropriate format, but none of formats of to_dict method can handle multiple values for one key. It took me a while to figure out how to use set_index, groupby, and apply methods together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What did you learn while working on this project? (regarding writing code and not only)\n",
    "While working on this project, I learned how to collaborate with others on GitHub using clones, forks, pull requests. This is the first time I realized how the comments and tags features can reduce the burden of communicating back and forth and make the information sharing much more convenient. I also learned how to how to use dataframe methods or comprehensions to make the code more efficient without iterating through rows or columns of dataframes because it can be a lot more time consuming when working on a bigger data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you had more time on the project what other question(s) would you like to answer? (at least one question is required)\n",
    "If I had more time on the project, I would look for pathways that contains the highest numbers of genes, which are likely to be an overview of multiple pathways, such as biosynthesis of amino acids (hsa01230). These can help with visualizing the difference of metabolic trends when there are different groups or time points in a study."
